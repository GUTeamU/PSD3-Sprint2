# Installation

1. Clone the repository

2. Run the `install.sh` script

**NOTE:** By default `JAVA_HOME` is set to `/usr/lib/jvm/java-1.7.0-openjdk.x86_64` to match the 3rd year lab machine setup, if this doesn't match your configuration, edit the value of `JDK_DIR` in `install.sh` before running it.

# Usage

1. Setup the environment:
```bash
source bootstrap.sh
```

2. Run the application:
```bash
spring run app.groovy
```
